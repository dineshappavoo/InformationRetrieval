Information Retreival
=======================

Information retrieval is the activity of obtaining information resources relevant to an information need from a collection of information resources. Searches can be based on metadata or on full-text (or other content-based) indexing.

Automated information retrieval systems are used to reduce what has been called "information overload". Many universities and public libraries use IR systems to provide access to books, journals and other documents. Web search engines are the most visible IR applications.

###program to gather information about tokens in the Cranfield database
In the Cranfield collection, document and field boundaries are indicated with SGML tags ("document markup"). SGML tags are not considered words, so they should not be included in any of the information your program gathers. The SGML tags in this data follow the conventional style:
<[/]?tag> | >[/]?tag (attr[=value])+>The attributes and the values from the SGML conventional style are optional and appear rarely or not at all in this data collection.
Use your program to generate the following information.* The number of tokens in the Cranfield text collection;
* The number of unique (e.g. distinct) tokens in the Cranfield text collection ;* The number of tokens that occur only once in the Cranfield text collection;* The 30 most frequent word tokens in the Cranfield text collection â€“ list them and their respective frequency information; and* The average number of word tokens per document.
